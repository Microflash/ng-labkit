# Development

ng-labkit is an [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)-generated project which builds and serves the app using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). For a local setup, clone this repository and run `yarn` to get started.

#### Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Use [ng generate](https://angular.io/cli/generate) to scaffold components, services, modules, etc.

#### Build

Run `yarn build` to generate a production build. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/ng-labkit/` directory.

ng-labkit comes with linting, testing and coverage workflows out-of-the-box.

#### Linting scripts and styles

Run `yarn lint` to lint scripts (with [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)) and styles (with [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)).

#### Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `yarn e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
